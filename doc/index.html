System dependencies:  you will be in a world of hurt unless you have
Perl DBI/DBD installed (so that a Perl script on your computer can talk
to Oracle) and a mailer configured to exec a procedure when mail arrives
addressed to a particular alias. See Appendix for installation tips.

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

You can build a gateway for handling incoming email messages for your
application using a Perl script called
<code>queue-message.pl</code>. That Perl script will accept an incoming
email message from the mailer and insert its contents into a queue
table in the database. A procedure can be scheduled to sweep the queue
at some interval to process the messages.
<p>

<h3>Using the <code>queue-message.pl</code> script</h3>

The script takes a list of command-line arguments, which tell it
which database to connect to, and a classification tag for the message.
<p>
<pre>
  usage: queue_message.pl db_user db_passwd tag

  Inserts the data from stdin into a queue table.

  Assumes the following table and sequence are defined in the db:

    create table incoming_email_queue (
            id          integer primary key,
            tag         varchar(256),
            content             clob,           -- the entire raw message content
                                                -- including all headers
            arrival_time        date
    );

    create sequence incoming_email_queue_sequence;

</pre>

The <b>tag</b> field is a string tag which you can assign
to a message, so that the routine which sweeps the queue can distinguish where
it came from. You might use this if you had several different mail recipient aliases
on your system, which all accept messages and put the into the queue.
<p>

To configure your mailer, you must add a mailer alias which invokes 
the script. For sendmail, this would be done in the aliases file. For qmail,
you create a file in the <code>qmail/alias</code> directory with a name
<code>.qmail-<i>your-alias-here</i></code>.
 <p>
Example: You are setting up an email handler for user feedback messages which
are addressed to <tt>user-feedback@yourhost</tt>:
<pre>
/var/alias/.qmail-user-feedback:
|/web/yourwebserver/packages/email-handler/bin/queue-message.pl yourdbuser yourdbpassword user_feedback
</pre>

The alias above specified that incoming messages will be piped to the
perl script, which will connect to the specified database, and will
insert the message with the tag "user_feedback".
<p>


Some guidelines: Try to sure that the <i>from</i> and <i>reply-to</i>
headers on your outgoing message are <b>not</b> the same as your
incoming mail handler alias. This will help prevent the possibility of
nasty mailer loops, in the case where messages may bounce or be returned
for some reason.

<h3>Scheduled Procedures and Parsing Mail Messages</h3>

The Perl script doesn't do anything except fill the
<code>incoming_email_queue</code> Oracle table.  A scheduled procedure
, process_email_queue, is launched by the email-handler at server
startup to sweep the email queue table.  It will dispatch on each
message tag to call a procedure which you specify in the DispatchTable
parameter of the email-handler package.

<p>
<h3>Setting Up A Mapping From A Tag To An Email Handler Procedure</h3>

The email-handle package parameter called <tt>DispatchTable</tt> lets
you set up a mapping between tagged incoming email messages and Tcl
procedures to handle them.
<p>
The <tt>DispatchTable</tt> parameter should be set to a list of key-value
pairs where the key matches a tag which you used in your call to
<tt>queue-message.pl</tt> and the value is the name of  a Tcl procedure
to run on the message contents.
<p>

When installing the email handler, you must go to the Site Map on your
ACS web server and instantiate a copy of the package with the name
'email-handler'. It should be mounted at /email-handler in order to
edit it's parameters, although you can probably mount it at another
URL and it will still work.

<p>
Once it is mounted, you will see the 
<tt>DispatchTable</tt> parameter, with a default value as shown:
<pre>
  DispatchTable   =>  user_feedback|email_handler_test
</pre>

The example above specifies that tickets with the tag "user_feedback" will
be passed to the procedure <code>email_handler_test</code>.
<p>
You can set <tt>DispatchTable</tt> to a list of space-separated key-value
pairs, for example 
<pre>
user_feedback|email_handler_test ticket|handle_ticket_tracker_email bboard|handle_bboard_mail
</pre>
<p>

The Tcl procedure invoked by the dispatcher is passed one argument, a
string containing the raw message text including headers. It is up to
you to parse or handle the message in any way you wish. After the call
to your dispatch procedure, the message is deleted from the queue.

<h3>Email Handling Utilities</h3>
Some routines in <code>/tcl/email-utils</code> will help you
parse the raw mail message contents in the db. 
<dl>
<dt><code>parse_email_message <i>message_body</i></code>
<dd>returns an ns_set mapping each mail header to its value, as well as
a key named <i>message_body</i> which contains the message body text.
<dt> clean_up_html <i>html_text</i>
<dd> Returns the html_text with all HTML escape characters quoted properly.
</dl>

<h3>Testing The Installation</h3>

<ol>
<li> Mount the email handler at /email-handler via the Site Map admin pages.
<p>
<li> Add  a mapping parameter to the email handler dispatch table which looks like

<pre>
email-test|email_handler_test
</pre>

To do this, go to the Site Map page in your ACS admin area, and click <b>Set Parameters</b> on the
email-handler mount point. Set the parameter DispatchTable to the above value.
<p>
<li> Test the installation by manually calling the queue-message.pl script as follows from a shell:
<pre>
% /web/yourserver/packages/email-handler/bin/queue-message.pl yourdbuser yourdbpasswd email-test
this is some
test email message stuff
^D

</pre>
The perl script should insert an entry into the table <tt>incoming_email_queue</tt>,  which should
then (within 10 minutes) get handled by the email handler test procedure and stuffed into the
<tt>email_handler_test</tt> table, where it can be viewed by the test web page at /email-handler
on your server.
<p>



<li> Create a mailer alias file to  accept mail for the address <tt>acs-mail-test</tt>
and stick them into the database with the tag 'email-test':

<pre>
For qmail,  put the following into a file named
/var/qmail/alias/.qmail-acs-mail-test

<b>|/web/yourwebserver/packages/email-handler/bin/queue-message.pl <i>yourdbuser</i> <i>yourdbpassword</i> email-test</b>
</pre>

<p>
<li> Send email to the address acs-mail-test@yourserver
<p>
<li> Check that the mail appears in the /email-handler test page query within ten minutes.
</ol>

<h3>Tips for Oracle 8i Achievers</h3>

Oracle 8i (8.1.5 and later) includes a Java virtual machine.  You are
thus able to load up a Java email parsing library that will take apart
the messages in a queue very nicely (presumably more robustly than the
Tcl parse_email_message). That would include goodies like parsing out
MIME attachments. The ACS Webmail package uses this facility. <p>

There is also a new Tcl standard library available from <a
href=http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcllib/>http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcllib/</a>
which includes MIME decoding routines. This is not loaded by default with
ACS 4, but can be downloaded and installed if needed.

<h3>Appendix: Installing Perl DBI</h3>

It is necessary to install the Perl DBI module and DBD Oracle driver
module.
 These can be obtained from the web site below:
<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBD::Oracle">DBD Oracle Driver</a> 

<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=DBI">Oracle DBI package</a>
<p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<ul>
<li> Untar the Perl DBI and DBD Oracle packages in the packages/email-handler/perl directory
<p>

<pre>
% cd perl
% tar -zxvf DBD-Oracle-1.06.tar.gz
% tar -zxvf DBI-1.14.tar.gz

<i> Install DBI module</i>
% cd DBI-1.14
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% su
# make install
# cd ..

<i> On Linux (and possibly Solaris), this is needed to allow the
DBD Oracle driver to find the libcntlsh.so loadable module from the
Oracle installation.
</i>
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/ora8/m01/app/oracle/product/8.1.6/lib
<i> Install Oracle Driver module</i>
# cd DBD-Oracle-1.06
# perl Makefile.PL
# make
# make test
# su 
# make install
# cd ..
</pre>

<p>
<li> Test the Perl DBI installation using the <tt>test-perl-dbi.pl</tt>
script in the bin directory. 

<p>It may be necessary to change the location of the Perl executable
at the start of the <tt>test-perl-dbi</tt> and <tt>queue-message.pl</tt>
scripts. To find the location of your Perl (> 5.004) executable, you 
can type
<pre>
# <b>type perl</b>  <i>(if you are using bash)</i>
# perl is hashed (/usr/local/bin/perl)
or
# <b>where perl</b> <i>(if you are using csh)</i>
</pre>

Change the first line of the scripts to this location:
<pre>
#!<path to perl>
</pre>
<p>
</ul>

<p>
Workaround for Problem I experienced with Linux: In the case that Perl
DBI cannot resolve the Oracle shared library location for the driver,
you may need to make a shell script to set the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

I defined a shell script called <tt>queue-message.sh</tt> which sets
the enviroment for running an Oracle client:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

. /etc/profile

export ORACLE_BASE=/ora8/m01/app/oracle
export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/8.1.6
export PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
export ORACLE_SID=ora8
export ORACLE_TERM=vt100
export ORA_NLS33=$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/data

NLS_LANG=.UTF8
export NLS_LANG

NLS_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY-MM-DD
export NLS_DATE_FORMAT

TZ=GMT
export TZ

exec `dirname $0`/queue-message.pl $*
</pre>





<h4>Installing hook from your mailer</h4>

These are instructions for calling the <tt>queue-message.pl</tt>
script from a mailer when mail arrives to a designated alias or
aliases.  The instructions are for qmail, but configuring other
mailers like sendmail to call the script is straightforward, as long
as you can figure out how to get your mailer to execute a script on
when an email arrives to a specific address.

<p>
For qmail, you need to create an alias file. In a standard installation this
would probably be a file named <tt>/var/qmail/alias/.qmail-<i>your-alias-address</i></tt>,
containing a call to exec the <tt>queue-message.pl</tt> script:

<pre>
<b>|/web/yourwebserver/packages/email-handler/bin/queue-message.pl <i>yourdbuser</i> <i>yourdbpassword</i> <i>tagname</i></b>
</pre>
